class LinearTreeRegressor(_LinearTree, RegressorMixin):
    """A Linear Tree Regressor.

    A Linear Tree Regressor is a meta-estimator that combine the learning
    ability of Decision Tree and the predictive power of Linear Models.
    Like in tree-based algorithms, the received data are splitted according
    simple decision rules. The goodness of slits is evaluated in gain terms
    fitting linear models in each node. This implies that the models in the
    leaves are linear instead of constant approximations like in classical
    Decision Tree.

    Parameters
    ----------
    estimator : object
        The base estimator to fit on dataset splits.
        The base estimator must be a sklearn.linear_model.

    criterion : {"mse", "rmse", "mae", "poisson"}, default="mse"
        The function to measure the quality of a split. "poisson"
        requires ``y >= 0``.

    max_depth : int, default=5
        The maximum depth of the tree considering only the splitting nodes.
        A higher value implies a higher training time.

    min_samples_split : int or float, default=6
        The minimum number of samples required to split an internal node.
        The minimum valid number of samples in each node is 6.
        A lower value implies a higher training time.
        - If int, then consider `min_samples_split` as the minimum number.
        - If float, then `min_samples_split` is a fraction and
          `ceil(min_samples_split * n_samples)` are the minimum
          number of samples for each split.

    min_samples_leaf : int or float, default=0.1
        The minimum number of samples required to be at a leaf node.
        A split point at any depth will only be considered if it leaves at
        least `min_samples_leaf` training samples in each of the left and
        right branches.
        The minimum valid number of samples in each leaf is 3.
        A lower value implies a higher training time.
        - If int, then consider `min_samples_leaf` as the minimum number.
        - If float, then `min_samples_leaf` is a fraction and
          `ceil(min_samples_leaf * n_samples)` are the minimum
          number of samples for each node.

    max_bins : int, default=25
        The maximum number of bins to use to search the optimal split in each
        feature. Features with a small number of unique values may use less than
        ``max_bins`` bins. Must be lower than 120 and larger than 10.
        A higher value implies a higher training time.

    min_impurity_decrease : float, default=0.0
        A node will be split if this split induces a decrease of the impurity
        greater than or equal to this value.

    categorical_features : int or array-like of int, default=None
        Indicates the categorical features.
        All categorical indices must be in `[0, n_features)`.
        Categorical features are used for splits but are not used in
        model fitting.
        More categorical features imply a higher training time.
        - None : no feature will be considered categorical.
        - integer array-like : integer indices indicating categorical
          features.
        - integer : integer index indicating a categorical
          feature.

    split_features : int or array-like of int, default=None
        Defines which features can be used to split on.
        All split feature indices must be in `[0, n_features)`.
        - None : All features will be used for splitting.
        - integer array-like : integer indices indicating splitting features.
        - integer : integer index indicating a single splitting feature.

    linear_features : int or array-like of int, default=None
        Defines which features are used for the linear model in the leaves.
        All linear feature indices must be in `[0, n_features)`.
        - None : All features except those in `categorical_features`
          will be used in the leaf models.
        - integer array-like : integer indices indicating features to
          be used in the leaf models.
        - integer : integer index indicating a single feature to be used
          in the leaf models.

    n_jobs : int, default=None
        The number of jobs to run in parallel for model fitting.
        ``None`` means 1 using one processor. ``-1`` means using all
        processors.
        
    base_estimator : object, default="deprecated"
        Use `estimator` instead.
        .. deprecated:: 0.3.6
            `base_estimator` is deprecated and will be removed in 1.0.0
            Use `estimator` instead.

    Attributes

class LinearBoostRegressor(_LinearBoosting, RegressorMixin):
    """A Linear Boosting Regressor.

    A Linear Boosting Regressor is an iterative meta-estimator that starts
    with a linear regressor, and model the residuals through decision trees.
    At each iteration, the path leading to highest error (i.e. the worst leaf)
    is added as a new binary variable to the base model. This kind of Linear
    Boosting can be considered as an improvement over general linear models
    since it enables incorporating non-linear features by residuals modeling.

    Parameters
    ----------
    estimator : object
        The base estimator iteratively fitted.
        The base estimator must be a sklearn.linear_model.

    loss : {"linear", "square", "absolute", "exponential"}, default="linear"
        The function used to calculate the residuals of each sample.

    n_estimators : int, default=10
        The number of boosting stages to perform. It corresponds to the number
        of the new features generated.

    max_depth : int, default=3
        The maximum depth of the tree. If None, then nodes are expanded until
        all leaves are pure or until all leaves contain less than
        min_samples_split samples.

    min_samples_split : int or float, default=2
        The minimum number of samples required to split an internal node:

        - If int, then consider `min_samples_split` as the minimum number.
        - If float, then `min_samples_split` is a fraction and
          `ceil(min_samples_split * n_samples)` are the minimum
          number of samples for each split.

    min_samples_leaf : int or float, default=1
        The minimum number of samples required to be at a leaf node.
        A split point at any depth will only be considered if it leaves at
        least ``min_samples_leaf`` training samples in each of the left and
        right branches.  This may have the effect of smoothing the model,
        especially in regression.

        - If int, then consider `min_samples_leaf` as the minimum number.
        - If float, then `min_samples_leaf` is a fraction and
          `ceil(min_samples_leaf * n_samples)` are the minimum
          number of samples for each node.

    min_weight_fraction_leaf : float, default=0.0
        The minimum weighted fraction of the sum total of weights (of all
        the input samples) required to be at a leaf node. Samples have
        equal weight when sample_weight is not provided.

    max_features : int, float or {"auto", "sqrt", "log2"}, default=None
        The number of features to consider when looking for the best split:

        - If int, then consider `max_features` features at each split.
        - If float, then `max_features` is a fraction and
          `int(max_features * n_features)` features are considered at each
          split.
        - If "auto", then `max_features=n_features`.
        - If "sqrt", then `max_features=sqrt(n_features)`.
        - If "log2", then `max_features=log2(n_features)`.
        - If None, then `max_features=n_features`.

        Note: the search for a split does not stop until at least one
        valid partition of the node samples is found, even if it requires to
        effectively inspect more than ``max_features`` features.

    random_state : int, RandomState instance or None, default=None
        Controls the randomness of the estimator.

    max_leaf_nodes : int, default=None
        Grow a tree with ``max_leaf_nodes`` in best-first fashion.
        Best nodes are defined as relative reduction in impurity.
        If None then unlimited number of leaf nodes.

    min_impurity_decrease : float, default=0.0
        A node will be split if this split induces a decrease of the impurity
        greater than or equal to this value.

    ccp_alpha : non-negative float, default=0.0
        Complexity parameter used for Minimal Cost-Complexity Pruning. The
        subtree with the largest cost complexity that is smaller than
        ``ccp_alpha`` will be chosen. By default, no pruning is performed. See
        :ref:`minimal_cost_complexity_pruning` for details.
        
    base_estimator : object, default="deprecated"
        Use `estimator` instead.
        .. deprecated:: 0.3.6
            `base_estimator` is deprecated and will be removed in 1.0.0
            Use `estimator` instead.
    Attributes
    ----------
    n_features_in_ : int
        The number of features when :meth:`fit` is performed.

    n_features_out_ : int
        The total number of features used to fit the base estimator in the
        last iteration. The number of output features is equal to the sum
        of n_features_in_ and n_estimators.

    coef_ : array of shape (n_features_out_, ) or (n_targets, n_features_out_)
        Estimated coefficients for the linear regression problem.
        If multiple targets are passed during the fit (y 2D), this is a
        2D array of shape (n_targets, n_features_out_), while if only one target
        is passed, this is a 1D array of length n_features_out_.

    intercept_ : float or array of shape (n_targets, )
        Independent term in the linear model. Set to 0 if `fit_intercept = False`
        in `estimator`

    Examples
    --------

class LinearForestRegressor(_LinearForest, RegressorMixin):
    """"A Linear Forest Regressor.

    Linear forests generalizes the well known random forests by combining
    linear models with the same random forests.
    The key idea of linear forests is to use the strength of linear models
    to improve the nonparametric learning ability of tree-based algorithms.
    Firstly, a linear model is fitted on the whole dataset, then a random
    forest is trained on the same dataset but using the residuals of the
    previous steps as target. The final predictions are the sum of the raw
    linear predictions and the residuals modeled by the random forest.

    Parameters
    ----------
    estimator : object
        The linear estimator fitted on the raw target.
        The linear estimator must be a regressor from sklearn.linear_model.

    n_estimators : int, default=100
        The number of trees in the forest.

    max_depth : int, default=None
        The maximum depth of the tree. If None, then nodes are expanded until
        all leaves are pure or until all leaves contain less than
        min_samples_split samples.

    min_samples_split : int or float, default=2
        The minimum number of samples required to split an internal node:

        - If int, then consider `min_samples_split` as the minimum number.
        - If float, then `min_samples_split` is a fraction and
          `ceil(min_samples_split * n_samples)` are the minimum
          number of samples for each split.

    min_samples_leaf : int or float, default=1
        The minimum number of samples required to be at a leaf node.
        A split point at any depth will only be considered if it leaves at
        least ``min_samples_leaf`` training samples in each of the left and
        right branches.  This may have the effect of smoothing the model,
        especially in regression.

        - If int, then consider `min_samples_leaf` as the minimum number.
        - If float, then `min_samples_leaf` is a fraction and
          `ceil(min_samples_leaf * n_samples)` are the minimum
          number of samples for each node.

    min_weight_fraction_leaf : float, default=0.0
        The minimum weighted fraction of the sum total of weights (of all
        the input samples) required to be at a leaf node. Samples have
        equal weight when sample_weight is not provided.

    max_features : {"auto", "sqrt", "log2"}, int or float, default="auto"
        The number of features to consider when looking for the best split:

        - If int, then consider `max_features` features at each split.
        - If float, then `max_features` is a fraction and
          `round(max_features * n_features)` features are considered at each
          split.
        - If "auto", then `max_features=n_features`.
        - If "sqrt", then `max_features=sqrt(n_features)`.
        - If "log2", then `max_features=log2(n_features)`.
        - If None, then `max_features=n_features`.

        Note: the search for a split does not stop until at least one
        valid partition of the node samples is found, even if it requires to
        effectively inspect more than ``max_features`` features.

    max_leaf_nodes : int, default=None
        Grow trees with ``max_leaf_nodes`` in best-first fashion.
        Best nodes are defined as relative reduction in impurity.
        If None then unlimited number of leaf nodes.

    min_impurity_decrease : float, default=0.0
        A node will be split if this split induces a decrease of the impurity
        greater than or equal to this value.

    bootstrap : bool, default=True
        Whether bootstrap samples are used when building trees. If False, the
        whole dataset is used to build each tree.

    oob_score : bool, default=False
        Whether to use out-of-bag samples to estimate the generalization score.
        Only available if bootstrap=True.

    n_jobs : int, default=None
        The number of jobs to run in parallel. :meth:`fit`, :meth:`predict`,
        :meth:`decision_path` and :meth:`apply` are all parallelized over the
        trees. ``None`` means 1 unless in a :obj:`joblib.parallel_backend`
        context. ``-1`` means using all processors.

    random_state : int, RandomState instance or None, default=None
        Controls both the randomness of the bootstrapping of the samples used
        when building trees (if ``bootstrap=True``) and the sampling of the
        features to consider when looking for the best split at each node
        (if ``max_features < n_features``).

    ccp_alpha : non-negative float, default=0.0
        Complexity parameter used for Minimal Cost-Complexity Pruning. The
        subtree with the largest cost complexity that is smaller than
        ``ccp_alpha`` will be chosen. By default, no pruning is performed. See
        :ref:`minimal_cost_complexity_pruning` for details.

    max_samples : int or float, default=None
        If bootstrap is True, the number of samples to draw from X
        to train each base estimator.

        - If None (default), then draw `X.shape[0]` samples.
        - If int, then draw `max_samples` samples.
        - If float, then draw `max_samples * X.shape[0]` samples. Thus,
          `max_samples` should be in the interval `(0, 1]`.
    base_estimator : object, default="deprecated"
        Use `estimator` instead.
        .. deprecated:: 0.3.6
            `base_estimator` is deprecated and will be removed in 1.0.0
            Use `estimator` instead.

    Attributes
    ----------
    n_features_in_ : int
        The number of features when :meth:`fit` is performed.

    feature_importances_ : ndarray of shape (n_features, )
        The impurity-based feature importances.
        The higher, the more important the feature.
        The importance of a feature is computed as the (normalized)
        total reduction of the criterion brought by that feature.  It is also
        known as the Gini importance.

    coef_ : array of shape (n_features, ) or (n_targets, n_features)
        Estimated coefficients for the linear regression problem.
        If multiple targets are passed during the fit (y 2D), this is a
        2D array of shape (n_targets, n_features), while if only one target
        is passed, this is a 1D array of length n_features.

    intercept_ : float or array of shape (n_targets,)
        Independent term in the linear model. Set to 0 if `fit_intercept = False`
        in `estimator`.

    estimator_ : object
        A fitted linear model instance.

    forest_estimator_ : object
        A fitted random forest instance.

    For classification tasks the same approach used in regression context

    regressor is trained to approximate the residulas from logits and linear
    predictions. Finally the sigmoid of the combinded predictions are taken
    to obtain probabilities.
    The multi-label scenario is carried out using OneVsRestClassifier.

    max_depth : int, default=None
        The maximum depth of the tree. If None, then nodes are expanded until

          number of samples for each split.

    min_samples_leaf : int or float, default=1
        The minimum number of samples required to be at a leaf node.
        A split point at any depth will only be considered if it leaves at

          number of samples for each node.

    min_weight_fraction_leaf : float, default=0.0

    max_features : {"auto", "sqrt", "log2"}, int or float, default="auto"
        The number of features to consider when looking for the best split:

        - If int, then consider `max_features` features at each split.
        - If float, then `max_features` is a fraction and
          `round(max_features * n_features)` features are considered at each
          split.
        - If "auto", then `max_features=n_features`.
        - If "sqrt", then `max_features=sqrt(n_features)`.
        - If "log2", then `max_features=log2(n_features)`.
        - If None, then `max_features=n_features`.

        Note: the search for a split does not stop until at least one
        valid partition of the node samples is found, even if it requires to
        effectively inspect more than ``max_features`` features.

    max_leaf_nodes : int, default=None
        Grow trees with ``max_leaf_nodes`` in best-first fashion.

    min_impurity_decrease : float, default=0.0
        A node will be split if this split induces a decrease of the impurity
        greater than or equal to this value.

        Only available if bootstrap=True.

    n_jobs : int, default=None

        :meth:`decision_path` and :meth:`apply` are all parallelized over the
        trees. ``None`` means 1 unless in a :obj:`joblib.parallel_backend`
        context. ``-1`` means using all processors.

    random_state : int, RandomState instance or None, default=None
        Controls both the randomness of the bootstrapping of the samples used
        when building trees (if ``bootstrap=True``) and the sampling of the
        features to consider when looking for the best split at each node
        (if ``max_features < n_features``).

    ccp_alpha : non-negative float, default=0.0
        Complexity parameter used for Minimal Cost-Complexity Pruning. The
        subtree with the largest cost complexity that is smaller than

        :ref:`minimal_cost_complexity_pruning` for details.

    max_samples : int or float, default=None
        If bootstrap is True, the number of samples to draw from X
